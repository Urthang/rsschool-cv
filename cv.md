## Briefly about me

I had many different professions from an automatic accounting systems engineer to car mechanic and small bicycle shop owner. Many of them was associated with sales. At some point I tired of selling and repairing something that made by others. I want to explore and create by myself or help with creating something important. I started my acquaintance with web dev from Tilda last year. Now I have decided to go deeper, to the roots, to the code itself. I like to learn new things and I want to learn a demand and interesting profession, which is always evolving.
